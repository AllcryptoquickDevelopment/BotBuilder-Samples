# nlp-with-luis sample
Bot Builder v4 natural language processing with LUIS bot sample

This bot has been created using [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com),

This sample shows how to create a bot that uses Language Understanding (LUIS) to extract the intents from a user's message.

## Concepts introduced in this sample
[Language Understanding (LUIS)](https://www.luis.ai) is a cloud-based API service that applies custom machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information.

## LUIS
Language Understanding service (LUIS) allows your application to understand what a person wants in their own words. LUIS uses machine learning to allow developers to build applications that can receive user input in natural language and extract meaning from it.


## Prerequisite
This sample requires prerequisites in order to run.
- [Required Prerequisites][41]


## To try this sampleâ—Š
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a console, navigate to `samples/javascript_typescript/12.nlp-with-luis`
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_typescript/12.nlp-with-luis
    ```
- Install modules
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Build the bot source code
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
- Setup LUIS
    Assuming prerequisites have been installed:
    ```bash
    # log into Azure
    az login
    ```
    ```bash
    # set you Azure subscription
    az account set --subscription "<azure-subscription>"
    ```
    ```bash
    # Create LUIS service application
    msbot clone services --name "<your_bot_name>" --luisAuthoringKey <LUIS-authoring-key> --code-dir "." --location westus --sdkLanguage "Node" --folder deploymentScripts/msbotClone --verbose
    ```
- Start the bot
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```


## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator **v4**
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

### Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator v4
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration
- Navigate to `samples/javascript_typescript/12.nlp-with-luis` folder
- Select `nlp-with-luis.bot` file


# Deploy the bot to Azure
After creating the bot and testing it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere.  To deploy your bot to Azure:

```bash
# login to Azure
az login
```

### Publishing Changes to Azure Bot Service
As you make changes to your locally running bot, you can deploy those changes to Azure Bot Service using a _publish_ helper.  See `publish.cmd` if you are on Windows or `./publish` if you are on a non-Windows platform.  The following is an example of publishing local changes to Azure:

```bash
# build the TypeScript bot before you publish
npm run build
```

```bash
# run the publish helper (non-Windows) to update Azure Bot Service.  Use publish.cmd if running on Windows
./publish
```

### Getting Additional Help with Deploying to Azure
To learn more about deploying a bot to Azure, see [Deploy your bot to Azure][40] for a complete list of deployment instructions.

## How to Modify a language model
This sample uses a language model to train LUIS.  The source for the language model can be found in the `cognitiveModels\reminders.lu`.  The `.lu` (language understanding) file describes language understanding components for your bot.  `.lu` files are text files and can be modified to change what language your bot will understand.  The `ludown` CLI tool takes as input a `.lu` file and produces a `.json` file.  This `.json` file is then used as input to the `luis` CLI tool to train your LUIS application's language understanding model.

### Train and publish the LUIS models
If you modify `reminders.lu` you need to train and publish the LUIS model. You can do so using the `ludown` and `luis` CLI tools.

### Install `ludown` and `luis` CLI tools
    ```bash
    # install the ludown CLI tool
    npm install -g ludown
    ```
    ```bash
    # install the LUIS CLI tool
    npm install -g luis
    ```
To learn more about the `ludown` CLI tool, refer to the documentation found [here](https://aka.ms/using-ludown).

To learn more about the `luis` CLI tool, refer to the documentation found [here](https://aka.ms/using-luis-cli).

### Example running `ludown` and `luis`
The following examples will train and publish a LUIS model:

```bash
msbot get "Reminders" | luis train version --wait --stdin
msbot get "Reminders" | luis publish version --stdin
```
